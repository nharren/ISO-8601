#### ISO 8601

From [Date and time format - ISO 8601](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm):

>##### What is ISO 8601?
>
>ISO 8601 describes an internationally accepted way to represent dates and times using numbers.
>
>When dates are represented with numbers they can be interpreted in different ways. For example, 01/05/12 could mean January 5, 2012, or May 1, 2012. On an individual level this uncertainty can be very frustrating, in a business context it can be very expensive. Organizing meetings and deliveries, writing contracts and buying airplane tickets can be very difficult when the date is unclear.
>
>ISO 8601 tackles this uncertainty by setting out an internationally agreed way to represent dates:
>
>YYYY-MM-DD
>
>For example, September 27, 2012 is represented as 2012-09-27.
>
>##### What can ISO 8601 do for me?
>
>ISO 8601 can be used by anyone who wants to use a standardized way of presenting dates and times. It helps cut out the uncertainty and confusion when communicating internationally.
>
>The full standard covers ways to write:
>
>- Date
>- Time of day
>- Coordinated universal time (UTC)
>- Local time with offset to UTC
>- Date and time
>- Time intervals
>- Recurring time intervals
